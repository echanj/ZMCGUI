
this directory contains the relevant files for the GUI buiding  

for help see 

/home/chane5/python_stuff/GUI_dev/page_examples

the subdirectories here should be most helpful  

Clone - spawn new gui windows 
complex - shows how to use tabs 
menu - pull down menu


so far only the main ZMC gui and some of the diffuse input file 
generation is done 

just need to composite button for run commands to a script file.
